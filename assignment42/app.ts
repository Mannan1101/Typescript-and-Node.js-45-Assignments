//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great
//() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call
// show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

let magicianName = ["ayaz", "daniyal", "manna", "kamran"]
